# JavaFit

The Java Fit project is a Java program designed to help users track their workouts and generate personalized reports. The program allows users to input their information, including name, age, and weight. Users can then log their daily workouts by selecting a focus area (e.g., legs, arms, core) and entering the exercises performed along with the number of reps. The program organizes this data into user-specific workout reports, displaying the date, focus area, exercises, and reps for each workout session. This project promotes user engagement and accountability in maintaining a healthy lifestyle by providing a convenient way to monitor and analyze fitness progress.
